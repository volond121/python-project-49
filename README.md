### List of games in the collection

1. **brain-even**
    *rules: whot number "even" or "not even" ?*

2. **brain-calc**
    *rules: count (arithmetic operations)*

3. **brain-gcd**
    *rules: finding a common divisor* 

4. **brain-prime**
    *rules: whot numbe "prime" or "not prime" ?*

5. **brain-progression**
    *rules: search for the dropped number from the progression*
